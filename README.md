Report on the Calculator

The provided Java code is an implementation of a simple console-based calculator application, which supports basic arithmetic operations,
 power calculations, square root, absolute value, rounding, and a history feature.
 It is structured in a way that allows users to input data interactively and get results in real-time.
 Below is a detailed explanation of the key components of the program.

 Overview of the Program
The Calculator class offers various mathematical operations that can be selected via a simple command-line menu. The program runs in a loop,
 continuously asking the user for input until the user chooses to exit. It also keeps a history of calculations performed during the session.
 
   1)Arithmetic Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulus)
The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
The user is asked to enter an expression in the format of num1 operator num2 (e.g., 2 + 3).
The input is parsed, validated, and the appropriate operation is performed. If the operator is invalid, or if the input is in an incorrect format,
 the program will display an error message.
   2)Power Calculation
The calculator allows the user to compute the power of a number by entering a base and an exponent (e.g., 2, 3 for 2^3).
It uses the Math.pow(base, exponent) function to compute the result and returns it to the user.
   3)Square Root Calculation
Users can input a number to compute its square root (e.g., sqrt(16) returns 4).
If the user attempts to take the square root of a negative number, an error message is displayed since square roots of
 negative numbers are not supported in real numbers.
   4)Absolute Value Calculation
The calculator computes the absolute value of a number (e.g., abs(-5) returns 5).
It uses the Math.abs(number) function for this operation.
  5)Rounding
The calculator can round a number to the nearest integer. For example, rounding 5.6 results in 6, and rounding 5.3 results in 5.
The Math.round(number) method is used for this purpose.
 6)History Feature
The program keeps track of all operations performed and their results in a history list.
The user can view the history by typing history in the menu. This feature helps the user review the previous calculations in the current session.
3. Input Validation
The program performs several checks to ensure that the input provided by the user is valid:

Invalid formats for numbers (e.g., non-numeric input).
Incorrect expressions, such as missing operators.
Division by zero, which is caught and handled to prevent crashes.
Invalid selection from the main menu is also caught, and the user is prompted to choose again.
 Strengths of the Code
The calculator is interactive and user-friendly, with a simple text-based interface.
The use of functions for different operations (basic arithmetic, power, sqrt, etc.) ensures that the code is modular and easy to maintain.
The history feature is a nice touch, allowing users to track their calculations.
Areas for Improvement
While the program checks for some common errors, it could benefit from more robust input validation, especially for edge cases (e.g., very large or small numbers).
The calculator could be enhanced by supporting more advanced operations, such as trigonometric functions or logarithms.
The current implementation doesn't allow for multiple calculations with one operator (e.g., chained operations like 2 + 3 + 4). Adding this feature could make the calculator more versatile.

This Java-based calculator provides a good starting point for basic arithmetic and mathematical operations. It is easy to use and handles most common calculation scenarios effectively. By enhancing its features and expanding the input validation, it could be developed into a more advanced and robust calculator application.
